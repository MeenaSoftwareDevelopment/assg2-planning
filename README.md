# Assignment 2 Planning

## General overview

Our assignment is to use **Python** to make one of three projects.

## Project Choices

*	**Connect 4** - Multiple players can engage in a simple, GUI-based game of Connect 4. **Requires GUI.**
*	**Zork** - Multiple players can play a simple, text-based (with images) adventure game. **Requires GUI.**
*	**Text Messaging** - Multiple users can send simple, text messages to each other. **Probably requires networking.**

<!-- So basically these are all horrible -->

## Assignment Brief Excerpt

### Project Requirements

* Platform: Cross Platform (Windows, Mac, Linux)
* Languages: Python 3.x
* Collaboration: GitHub

### Project Activities

1.	Review all available projects before deciding which to develop
2.	Consider your primary target audience (see Possible Project Target Demographics)
3.	Create an overall specification based on user and system requirements (including HCI, game-rules and the game-mechanics (e.g. what are the rules for the game, how will the game be controlled, how will any non-player characters interact, etc.)
4.	Create two different user profiles (based on your selected target type) – these profiles should include basic details regarding individual’s wants and needs associated with the game
5.	Determine the project’s high-level ‘functional specifications’ (e.g. what are the hardware requirements, operating system environment, application functions, collisions, AI, scores, timers, etc.)
6.	Determine the project’s high-level ‘non-functional’ specifications (aesthetic, usability, ease of use, feedback style, basic needs, etc.) 
7.	Create mock-ups for the overall look, user interface design, dialogue windows and input mechanisms, etc
8.	Construct basic storyboards associated with the game-play
9.	Identify and rank potential risks to the project’s success (such as: technical knowledge, coding, testing, scope, dependencies) – this should not include time management
10.	Identify and establish your software development strategy
11.	Define an overall test plan (this will be used later and may be repeated several times to ensure the project is successful).


### Activity 2 Group Guidance – Design Analysis Session

Refine and improve your overall specification and ideas by removing inappropriate or out-of-scope elements, simplify requirements, identify opportunities to improve and streamline HCI elements, game-play and game mechanics, etc.)

1.	Agree your project’s requirements ensuring you can deliver them successfully.
2.	Use basic pseudo code to help define, establish and quickly test high-level in-game functions, actions and logic (depending on your preference you may prefer to complete step 4 before step 3)
3.	Use basic UML flowcharts to help plan, design and test game logic, interaction, mechanics and flow
4.	Establish game state management (start, win, lose, draw) – confirm how the state could be monitored, detected or changed?
